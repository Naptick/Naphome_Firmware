config NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_ENABLE
    bool "Enable Matter bridge for sensor telemetry"
    default n
    help
        When enabled the firmware exposes collected sensor telemetry via the
        Matter application layer so that controllers on the fabric can observe
        state changes through standard clusters.

config NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_MAX_SENSORS
    int "Maximum number of bridged sensors"
    depends on NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_ENABLE
    default 8
    range 1 32
    help
        Upper bound for the number of logical sensors that can be exported via
        the Matter bridge component.

config NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_SENSOR_NAME_MAX_LEN
    int "Maximum sensor name length"
    depends on NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_ENABLE
    default 32
    range 8 96
    help
        Sensor identifiers are copied into a static registry. Increase if your
        sensor names exceed the default limit.

config NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT_LABEL_MAX_LEN
    int "Maximum endpoint label length"
    depends on NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_ENABLE
    default 32
    range 8 64
    help
        Friendly labels assigned to bridged endpoints are truncated to this
        length.

config NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_USE_ESPMATTER
    bool "Link against esp-matter and expose native Matter endpoints"
    depends on NAPHOME_MATTER_BRIDGE_ENABLE
    default n
    help
        Enable this option when building with the Espressif esp-matter
        component. When selected the bridge uses esp-matter APIs to create
        dynamic endpoints and update clusters. Leave disabled to build a stub
        bridge that logs state changes without interacting with the Matter
        stack (useful for bring-up and CI).
